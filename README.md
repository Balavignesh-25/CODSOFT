## Introduction
During my internship, I focused on several AI-related projects, ranging from rule-based chatbots to face detection and recognition. Each project is stored in a separate folder with relevant documentation to explain the key concepts and techniques used.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
*Description*: This project involves building a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. It helped me understand natural language processing and conversation flow.

- *Technologies*: Python
- *Skills Learned*: Rule-based systems, pattern matching
- *Project Folder*: [chatbot](./chatbot)

### Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
*Description*: I implemented an AI agent that plays Tic-Tac-Toe using the Game Theory and Minimax algorithm. The AI is designed to be unbeatable.

- *Technologies*: Python
- *Skills Learned*: Game theory, Minimax algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning
- *Project Folder*: [tic-tac-toe-ai](./tic-tac-toe-ai)

### Task 3: Face Detection and Recognition
*Description*: This project focuses on face detection and recognition using pre-trained models like Haar cascades and deep learning-based detectors.

- *Technologies*: Python, OpenCV
- *Skills Learned*: Face detection, computer vision, deep learning
- *Project Folder*: [face-detection-recognition](./face-detection-recognition)
